# A Comparative Analysis of Meta-heuristic Optimisation Algorithms for Vehicle Routing


## Abstract

Todayâ€™s popular "shared-economy" concept has accelerated the progress towards
prioritising the implementation of cost-efficient strategies and promoting sustainable
solutions, especially in the logistics and transportation sectors. This has directed more
attention towards the last-mile delivery logistics and the prohibitively expensive costs
associated with it. Hence, numerous approaches tackle this challenge by utilising
urban transportation resources in the supply chain. This is achieved by incorporating
parcel delivery into ride-sharing services by integrating parcel delivery requests with
passenger transportation route plans. Lying at the core of route planning is the
travelling salesman problem, which is a typical unresolved challenge in the field of
combinatorial optimisation, owing to the exponential time complexity and expensive
resources required by traditional algorithmic methods to compute the optimal
route. Meanwhile, several heuristic and meta-heuristic optimisation techniques such
as evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence-based algorithms or physics-based
algorithms have been developed in recent years in an attempt to effectively solve
optimisation problems. This thesis aims to compare the performance of three different
types of meta-heuristic algorithms (Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimisation
and Simulated Annealing) for the vehicle routing problem represented as travelling
salesman problem, based on two datasets: NYC Green Taxi dataset and Porto City
Taxi dataset. The performance of the three algorithms was evaluated on the basis of
computation efficiency in terms of time needed to find the solution and on the basis of
accuracy as well as reliability of the obtained solutions. The simulation results obtained
from both datasets show that simulated annealing provided the most accurate and
most reliable results, where ant colony optimisation came in second. On the other
hand, the genetic algorithm demonstrated the highest efficiency in terms of algorithm
runtime yet the quality of its results fell short in terms of accuracy and reliability.
